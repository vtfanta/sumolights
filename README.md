# Distributed traffic light state identification
Base repo cloned from [here](https://github.com/docwza/sumolights). I have deleted the RL and NN code (or just made it inactive).

## Setup

Install SUMO traffic microsimulator by [following instructions here](https://sumo.dlr.de/wiki/Installing) (v1.2).

Using Python 3, create a virtual environment and then install dependancies with:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
